## 🧩 Architecture

SimpleRTOS follows a modular architecture where each feature is implemented as a separate module within the `features` package. The main application (`main.py`) provides the UI framework and navigation, while the individual feature modules implement specific functionality.

Key components:
- **Main App**: Handles navigation, styling, and routing to feature modules
- **Feature Modules**: Self-contained implementations of specific features
- **Utils**: Shared utility functions used across multiple features

## 🤝 Contributing
